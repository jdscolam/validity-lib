# validity-lib
A fun little library for determining duplicate contacts.  There are both normal and advanced datasets for you to play with in the `/data` directory.

##Installation
Simply `clone` or `fork` the repository then run:
```
npm install
```
in the root of the repository.

##Run the App
```
npm start
```

**NOTE:** `main.js` in the root directory is the entry-point.  This is so ES6 node works properly ([thank you esm!](https://github.com/standard-things/esm))

##Run the Unit Tests
```
npm test
```
'nuff said.
